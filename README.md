# Okavango Delta Story Map
This story map illustrates the ecological importance of the Okavango Delta and how the human influeces like the ecotourism industry complicates conservation efforts of the delta.
Story map can be viewed [here][].

## Storytelling Structure

### Exposition
Landing page with video taken from a boat going along the Okavango River sets the scene for the type of landscape.

### Conflict
I think the conflict is hinted in the sub title of web map, "A Natural and Controlled System".

### Rising Action
The "Biodiversity" and "Parks and Reserves" scene sets up the issue of threats to wildlife. 

### Climax
The climax is the "Future Threats" scene. With a landscape already covered with human impact with the lodges, what exactly is being conserved and for whom?

### Falling Action/Resolution
Although there is no clear resolution for this issue, it at least leaves the map viewer with the question of how ecotouriusm helps or hinders conservation.
